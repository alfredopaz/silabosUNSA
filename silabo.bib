                 computational problems for which fast algorithms have
                 never been found, but neither have such algorithms been
                 proved to be unattainable. Those were the
                 primality-testing problem, for which the best-known
                 algorithm is delicately poised on the brink of
                 polynomial time, and the integer-factoring problem, for
                 which the known algorithms are in a more primitive
                 condition. In this chapter we will meet a large family
                 of such problems (hundreds of them now!). This family
                 is not just a list of seemingly difficult computational
                 problems. It is in fact bound together by strong
                 structural ties. The collection of problems, called the
                 NP -complete problems, includes many well known and
                 important questions in discrete mathematics, such as
                 the following. The travelling salesman problem (`TSP'):

                 [...] During the past 15 years, I have personally
                 helped design and implement three different operating
                 systems: TSS-11 (PDP-11), MINIX (IBM PC, Atari, Amiga,
                 Macintosh, and SPARC), and Amoeba (80386, Sun-3, SPARC,
                 and VAX). I have drawn on this long experience to
                 emphasize those topics that actually matter in real
                 systems. All the subjects that are expected in an
                 undergraduate text on operating systems are included
                 here, including processes, interprocess communication,
                 semaphores, monitors, message passing, classical IPC
                 problems, scheduling, swapping, virtual memory, paging
                 algorithms, segmentation, file systems, security, [...]

  abstract =    "We propose design patterns as a new mechanism for
                 expressing object-oriented design experience. Design
                 patterns identify, name, and abstract common themes in
                 object-oriented design. They capture the intent behind
                 a design by identifying objects, their collaborations,
                 and the distribution of responsibilities. Design
                 patterns play many roles in the object-oriented
                 development process: they provide a common vocabulary
                 for design, they reduce system complexity by naming and
                 defining abstractions, they constitute a base of
                 experience for building reusable software, and they act
                 as building blocks from which more complex designs can
                 be built. Design patterns can be considered reusable
                 micro-architectures that contribute to an overall
                 system architecture. We describe how to express and
                 organize design patterns and introduce a catalog of
                 design patterns. We also describe our experience in
                 applying design patterns to the design of
                 object-oriented systems.",
